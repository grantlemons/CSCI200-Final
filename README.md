# Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe {#mainpage}

Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe is a project that takes Tic-Tac-Toe too far.

## Gameplay

### Overview

Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe is extremely similar to regular Tic-Tac-Toe, players
familiar with the original can expect to pick up the expanded ruleset quickly.

Fundamentally, Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe is game of Tic-Tac-Toe where each cell of
the board (now called the "Primary Board") contains another Tic-Tac-Toe board
(called a Leaf Board).

Like in the original game, players take turns claiming cells until one claims
three in a row. In Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe, however, moves are made in the cells of
a Leaf Board.
Once a Leaf Board is won, the corresponding cell of the Primary Board is claimed
for the winner. Once three consecutive Leaf Boards have been won by the same
player (corresponding to cells of the Primary Board), that player wins the
Primary Board, and the game.

### Selecting Leaf Boards

Cells can only be claimed within the currently active Leaf Board.

At the start of the game, the X player selects a Leaf Board to make their play
in, as well as the cell of said Leaf Board they would like to claim.

In most other cases, however, the currently active Leaf Board is determined by
the cell of the Leaf Board previously claimed.
An exception applies when the Leaf Board that would be active is already won, in
which case the current player can select any unclaimed Leaf Board to activate.

Gameplay Example:

```
Primary Board     Active Leaf Board (0)     Description
   |A| | |              | | | |             X Selects the Leaf Board 0 and Leaf Cell 4.
   | | | |              | |X| |
   | | | |              | | | |
```

```
Primary Board     Active Leaf Board (4)     Description
   | | | |              | | | |             Leaf Board 4 is now active.
   | |A| |              | | | |             O must make a move in the newly active Leaf Board.
   | | | |              | | | |
```

```
Primary Board     Active Leaf Board (4)     Description
   | | | |              |O| | |             O Selects Leaf Cell 0.
   | |A| |              | | | |
   | | | |              | | | |
```

```

   | | | |              | |X| |             X must make a move in the newly active Leaf Board.
